This is my mobile app for helping with my fitness journey as well as anyone else who might use this app once it is complete.

My main goal for this app is to be able to track and view my powerlifting program easily. Currently, I use excel to write my programs and track my progress, this app will eliminate the need for that and will make it simpler to input workout information on my phone. The second goal for this app is to provide analytics based on the workouts logged so that I can view my progress.

The app is still in development and currently, I am only testing it for IOS. Since it is made using react native I plan on making it available on IOS and Android.

The app is written completely in JavaScript using React Native and Redux. I'm using Firebase authentication for user authentication and Firebase Firestore for my database. I am using Expo to run the app since I want to test the app on IOS, but I am using a Windows computer.
