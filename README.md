# FitnessApp

This is my mobile app for helping with your fitness journey.

My main  goal was to be able to track and view my powerlifting program easily. The second is to track my progress by displaying information in graphs.

The app is still in development and currently I am only testing it for IOS. Since it is made using react native I plan on making it available on 
IOS and Android.

The app is written completely in JavaScript using React Native and Redux. I'm using firebase authentication for user authentication and firebase firestore for my database.
